# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-17)

**Core value:** Joshua opens the tool and finds businesses genuinely worth pitching, with the proof already written, so that outreach costs him minutes instead of hours.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Prospect Data Foundation & Import

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Compliance Spine
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-07-18 — Phase 1 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: No blocking Phase 0. The provider/legal-basis decision is a parallel track gating Phase 8 only — user override of the research recommendation.
- [Roadmap]: Compliance spine (Phase 2) is a co-requisite of the data model, not the last phase. It has no dependencies and may run parallel with Phase 1.
- [Roadmap]: Triage (Phase 3) must ship before or with the scan queue (Phase 4). Load-bearing sequencing decision — queueing every import reintroduces the concurrency/budget failure CONCERNS.md flags.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 (lifecycle/reporting) placed before the gated send phase so it ships; ARCHITECTURE.md's "reporting last" ordering assumed send was not gated.
- [Research]: Resend ruled out for outreach (AUP prohibits cold outreach verbatim). Channel deliberately undecided.
- [Research]: Tw art. 11.7 lid 2(a) does not cover scraped `info@`. Default posture is legitimate interest + Article 14 notice.
- [Phase 01-01]: Live push (migrations 010-013) applied via Supabase dashboard SQL Editor, not supabase db push CLI — Matches convention used for migrations 001-009 on this project; all DDL is IF NOT EXISTS/idempotent so a future CLI push stays safe
- [Phase 01-02]: Human approved @duckdb/node-api and tldts as legitimate (official org repos, high download counts, too-new-publish false positive) before install
- [Phase 01-02]: Added vitest passWithNoTests:true so npx vitest run exits 0 before 01-03/01-04 add test files
- [Phase 01-03]: D-14 (no_website gains website) required no special-case code — the existing D-05 else-branch (website_url_pending) already applies since no_website prospects are never lifecycle_state='new'
- [Phase 01-03]: Added supabase/seed.sql (local-dev-only grants) to unblock local integration testing — repo had no prior supabase/config.toml/local-dev history, causing "permission denied" on all tables including pre-existing ones
- [Phase 01-04]: Region matching via addresses[1].region is impossible on real NL data; region scoping uses a bbox pre-filter for pruning plus an exact ST_Within polygon check against the Overture divisions theme (class=land to exclude maritime duplicates) as the true boundary
- [Phase 01-04]: Aggregator/directory domains (tripadvisor.com, facebook.com, etc.) are never valid prospect identity - resolved to no-website (null domain/website_url, lifecycle_state=no_website) inside upsertOverturePlace, while prospect_sources.raw_website_url preserves the original URL (D-11 human-approval condition)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 8 blocked** on the Parallel Track: send channel chosen + AUP verified in writing, counsel on LIA/Art. 14 wording, separate warmed outreach domain. Phases 1-7 proceed regardless.
- **Scoring verdict-threshold divergence** (`lib/scoring.ts` vs `scanner-service/src/index.ts`, 95/85/70/50 vs 90/70/50) is scheduled as the first plan of Phase 6 but is not a numbered v1 requirement. REQUIREMENTS.md may need an addition — see ROADMAP Coverage Notes.
- **Blast radius:** nothing in this milestone may risk the existing scanner's email or scanning. It works and it earns. Phase 4 verification watches the public scanner's success rate during bulk runs.
- **Overture data quality** is a proven risk here, not theoretical — prior research produced a 98% false-positive read before correction. Manual sample audit required in Phase 1.
