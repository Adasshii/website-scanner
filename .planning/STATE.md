# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-17)

**Core value:** Joshua opens the tool and finds businesses genuinely worth pitching, with the proof already written, so that outreach costs him minutes instead of hours.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Prospect Data Foundation & Import

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Prospect Data Foundation & Import)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-17 — Roadmap created; 66/66 v1 requirements mapped across 8 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: No blocking Phase 0. The provider/legal-basis decision is a parallel track gating Phase 8 only — user override of the research recommendation.
- [Roadmap]: Compliance spine (Phase 2) is a co-requisite of the data model, not the last phase. It has no dependencies and may run parallel with Phase 1.
- [Roadmap]: Triage (Phase 3) must ship before or with the scan queue (Phase 4). Load-bearing sequencing decision — queueing every import reintroduces the concurrency/budget failure CONCERNS.md flags.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 (lifecycle/reporting) placed before the gated send phase so it ships; ARCHITECTURE.md's "reporting last" ordering assumed send was not gated.
- [Research]: Resend ruled out for outreach (AUP prohibits cold outreach verbatim). Channel deliberately undecided.
- [Research]: Tw art. 11.7 lid 2(a) does not cover scraped `info@`. Default posture is legitimate interest + Article 14 notice.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 8 blocked** on the Parallel Track: send channel chosen + AUP verified in writing, counsel on LIA/Art. 14 wording, separate warmed outreach domain. Phases 1-7 proceed regardless.
- **Scoring verdict-threshold divergence** (`lib/scoring.ts` vs `scanner-service/src/index.ts`, 95/85/70/50 vs 90/70/50) is scheduled as the first plan of Phase 6 but is not a numbered v1 requirement. REQUIREMENTS.md may need an addition — see ROADMAP Coverage Notes.
- **Blast radius:** nothing in this milestone may risk the existing scanner's email or scanning. It works and it earns. Phase 4 verification watches the public scanner's success rate during bulk runs.
- **Overture data quality** is a proven risk here, not theoretical — prior research produced a 98% false-positive read before correction. Manual sample audit required in Phase 1.
